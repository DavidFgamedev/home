        I'm a game programmer and developer passionate about the game industry
        and pushing it's boundaries. Currently studying Computer Science 
        at Cal State; I earned my Game Dev Certificate from Unreal Authorized 
        Training at Vertex College's UE Game Development with C++ program. 
        Relevant coursework included MDA Framework, Bartle Taxonomy of
        Player Types, and advanced texturing techniques. My skillset also extends 
        to JS, Machine Learning, A.I. and a suite of testing and development 
        tools. Throughout my career I've also had the blessing of working for 
        studios like 2K and Playstation helping craft fun and engaging game 
        experiences.
